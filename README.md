## Description
Kim jestem (Who I Am) is an app game for meeting with friends, where you can find out who you are from a word which has been drawn for you based on the category you choose. This app is mainly for smartphones because when you choose your word you have to turn the phone and donâ€™t look for a screen, then ask your friends but only questions that can be answered yes or no. After answering you can always click on the screen when your word will be hidden and save your question. (Actually this app is only in Polish). The rest of the rules are on the website.
